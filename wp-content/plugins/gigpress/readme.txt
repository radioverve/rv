GigPress provides an easy way for bands to list and manage their concerts and tours on their WordPress-powered website.

== Description ==

**GigPress is a WordPress plugin built specifically for touring bands.** As a website developer who was often building websites for independent bands -- and always using WordPress as CMS of choice -- I was constantly frustrated by the lack of a simple, viable method of incorporating live shows and tours into these websites. So I decided to brush up on my PHP and build my own.

###Features###

GigPress incorporates all the common requests you might have for a plugin of its ilk, including:

* [NEW] Associate each show with a WordPress post
* [NEW] Duplicate shows for quicker entry
* [NEW] Undo the last-deleted show or tour
* Fully internationalized - includes French, Spanish, Dutch, German, Swedish, Italian and Polish language files
* Ability to list both upcoming shows and past shows, chronologically rolled-over as tour dates pass
* Grouping of shows into nameable tours
* Multiple-day shows
* An upcoming shows RSS feed
* hCalendar-rigged
* Auto-linking to Google Maps for venues with a street address
* Fields for show times, venue and ticket-buy URLs, age restrictions, ticket price, and notes
* Built-in functions to display upcoming shows, past shows, and a sidebar listing
* User-level access restrictions for use
* Widget support
* Outputs XHTML-compliant, semantic markup
