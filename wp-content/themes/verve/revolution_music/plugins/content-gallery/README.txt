Plugin Author: Jason Schuller
Uses SmoothGallery, a script developed by JonDesign's found at http://smoothgallery.jondesign.net/.
Requires at least: 2.3
Tested up to: 2.6.1
Plugin Version: 2.0

:: Description ::
Used to create a featured content gallery anywhere within your wordpress theme.

:: Installation ::
1. Download the zipped plugin file to your local machine from wpelements.com.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Upload the "content-gallery" folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory. (DO NOT CHANGE ANY FILE OR FOLDER NAMES)
4. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
5. Add the folowing code anywhere within your theme where you want the content gallery to be displayed.

<?php include (ABSPATH . '/wp-content/plugins/content-gallery/gallery.php'); ?>

:: Usage ::
After you download and activate the new featured content gallery plugin, you will first want to head over to the options page which will allow you to fully customize your gallery width, height, text overlay height, the category you want to use for gallery content as well as the number of gallery items you want to be displayed. 

The featured content gallery plugin is now fully automated which means that posting content is easier than ever. When writing a post that you want to be featured in the gallery, simply select the category you set within the plugin options page, upload an image to be displayed within the gallery and paste the path to that image in a custom field called “articleimg”. I have included a screenshot below to show you how a sample gallery post should look within WordPress.
